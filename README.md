# Sales-Analysis (fr)
Sales Analysis (in french) as a project for the Data Analyst degree at OpenClassrooms.
This is a sales analysis with classic sales analysis problems. We used Matplotlib, Seaborn among others. 
The statistical analysis part is a draft and is to be updated (Statistical tests, conditions only used as a tool in the course of reasoning but proper Satistical Analysis not written rigorously yet)
basket count loop written with the help of a classmate, Thanks Antoine!
